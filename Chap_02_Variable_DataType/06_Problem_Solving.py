# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.

a=int(input("Enter first number: "))
b=int(input("Enter Second number: "))
c=a+b
print("Adiition is ",c)



# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

b=int(input("Enter number to find reminder: "))
z=int(input("Enter number divident: "))
c=b%z
print("Reminder is ",c)



# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

b=float(input("Enter number to Check Data type: "))
print(type(b))



# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

a = 34 
b = 80
if a>b:
    print("A is greater than B")
else:
        print("A is Not greater than B")
